#Welcome
Hi! My name is Aleix Solanes and I am a developer. I am from Calaf, Catalonia. My main interests are sports, music and of course, coding.
I was born in 1989, and I have a degree in Computer Science. 
#Projects
As my final degree project, I create a project based on the main ideas of Data Science to find the places where a text talk from. All my projects are available to everyone through my personal github page.
